Eternal Seasons is an Multiplayer RPG set in an original world where you can explore and progress your character in the ever developing world. Gather friends and play together as you help each other through difficult quests and more difficult dungeons. And if you're down a player, you will be able to recruit some of many NPCs in the world to your party to see how far you can go. 

We are currently under active development (in our spare time) and working on game systems, class designs, world building elements, and more. We wish to provide updates here about all of these topics as we move towards delivering this experience.
